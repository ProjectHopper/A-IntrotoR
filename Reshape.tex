reshape: Flexibly reshape data

Reshape lets you flexibly restructure and aggregate data using just two functions: melt and cast.

Hadley Wickham has created a comprehensive package called reshape to massage data. Both an introduction and article are available. There is even a video!
Basically, you "melt" data so that each row is a unique id-variable combination. Then you "cast" the melted data into any shape you would like. Here is a very simple example.
